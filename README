Two separate docker containers to pull onto grace.
First is the Phobius directory, downloaded from https://phobius.sbc.su.se/data.html.
The phobius script was modified slightly to run the 64bit decodeanhmm binary, but otherwise it can just be run directly using perl.

Second is deeptmhmm from https://dtu.biolib.com/DeepTMHMM and
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.08.487609v1

singularity pull deeptmhmm_latest.sif docker://deeptmhmm/deeptmhmm:latest

To run deeptmhmm, use the deeptmhmm_scripts/run_deeptmhmm.sh script, which mounts the input and output directories and runs the prediction script inside the container. Make sure to modify the input_fasta_dir, input_fasta, and output_dir variables as needed.
